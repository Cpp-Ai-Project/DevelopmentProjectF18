The whole point of Merge Sort is to sort large amounts of data with a small 
amount of space. In this folder there is a folder of 8500 ints that are unsorted.

Things to know:
You only have the memory to process 500 ints at a time
Disk Space is not an issue
Ints in python during runtime are 24 bytes 

Sort the file, using merge sort, with those in mind.

*Hints*
Load the equivalent of 4gb of ints into memory
Sort them using merge sort
Save them
Repeat
